# usb-blaster
A repository to store altera usb-blaster driver for quartus since on newer versions of windows the certificate has expired on precedent versions of quartus (20 and before)

If the driver is not anymore up to date, create a issue and I will try to update it.
If you don't trust me and want to download this driver yourself, just install the last version of quartus and normally the issue will be gone.

I don't own any rights on this driver and if there is any problem on distributing this driver, create a issue or contact me at the address 70izg3xpm@mozmail.com
